Average # of computations = 11088
Recurrence relation :
base case: T(0) = c , T(1) = c
n + sum (m = 1 to n) (T(m-1) + T(n-m))

Average Case of Quicksort will run in O(nlogn) and Worst Case will run in O(n^2)

Quick sort is an in-order sort because no additional data structure is used to sort the input array.
Quick sort is not stable because the records with the same key are not guaranteed to appear in the same order
in the sorted list as in the original list.

Consider array: 5(1) 3 4 9 5(2) 5(3)
Pivot = 5(1)
4 3 5(1) 9 5(3) 5(2)
Need to sort 9 5(3) 5(2)
Pivot = 5(3)
5(3) 9 5(2)
Need to sort 9 5(2)
End with 5(3) 5(2) 9
